# It's TEACHERLESS TIME!!

# It's now time to learn all on your own, without help from me at all. Let's get right into the
# nitty-gritty of it all. These define function() Python examples are all you will ever need to
# be well on your way to start mastering Python. But you have to do this all on your own, I
# will not take you by the helping-hand this time. You must seek what you do not know; it's
# only then, you shall find it. You must do your own research, just like I had to once do it and
# I still do my own research, whenever I do not know something about anything, I wish to know
# or learn all about, such as with Python and breadboard electronics alike. Most things you
# will be able to find all on this entire community page. As for the return functions(). Happy
# Hunting. See Mosh to learn more. He will teach you all about Python. He was one of my
# very first VR Python teachers on YouTube, when I first started out. You have the key, now
# open wide the door into computer programming/computer science. It's all entirely up to YOU!
# I will not take you by the hand this time. Yet, I do offer a crumb of help, but not by much...

# Oh, one more thing. Don't forget about the '\' backslash hard return approach. I use it here
# in two places to fit the text all on one line of this YouTube textbox, as not to wrap it around to
# the next line.
