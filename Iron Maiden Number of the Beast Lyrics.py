Woe to you, oh earth and sea For the Devil sends
the beast with wrath. Because he knows the time is
short. Let him who hath understanding reckon the
number of the beast. For it is a human number Its
number is 666

I left alone, my mind was blank. I needed time to
think to get the memories from my mind. What did
I see? Can I believe? That what I saw that night
was real and not just fantasy?

Just what I saw in my old dreams. Were they reflections
of my warped mind staring back at me? 'Cause in my
dreams it's always there. The evil face that twists my
mind and brings me to despair

Night was black, was no use holding back 'Cause I
just had to see, was someone watching me? In the
mist, dark figures move and twist Was all this for real
or just some kind of Hell?

666, the number of the beast Hell and fire was spawned
to be released

Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised. As they
start to cry, hands held to the sky In the night, the fires
are burning bright. The ritual has begun, Satan's work is
done.

666, the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight

This can't go on, I must inform the law. Can this still
be real, or just some crazy dream? But I feel drawn
towards the chanting hordes. Seem to mesmerize, can't
avoid their eyes

666, the number of the beast
666, the one for you and me

I'm coming back, I will return. And I'll possess your body
and I'll make you burn. I have the fire, I have the force. I
have the power to make my evil take its course...
