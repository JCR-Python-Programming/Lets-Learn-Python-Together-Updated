# Some Heavy Metal Python Fun for Iron Maiden Fans, including myself am!!

# I still love this song, especially as a teenager. It was 1982 and I was smoking
# some really good stuff when I first heard this song on someone's old school
# ghetto blaster; we were all outside, just sitting around passing the fun all around.
# Just something about the 1980's that were just simpler and better. It's so sad that
# cellphones took that all away. No one physically speaks to anyone at all anymore.
# I never ever see anyone throw a frisbee anymore at all. What happened to our
# world, my generation grew up in? I sure do miss the Good Old 80's. Don't you!?

# This kind of music probably isn't everyone's cup of tea, but I sure loved it.
# Iron Maiden was New Wave Digital Aged Futuristic Heavy Metal. They started
# in 1979 and broke out in mid 1982 with Number of The Beast album. These
# guys are still at it today. They have their very own futuristic New Wave electronic
# Metal sound. Fastway was another New Wave sort of Punk Rock, but leaned into
# Heavy Metal on a more experimental way. I used to call Fastway. Punk Zeppelin,
# because the league singer sounded a bit like Robert Plant. These two bands were
# indeed on my ghetto blaster, along with RUSH, my most favorite of any band. I love
# Rush music. Futuristic Retro is what they are. They don't make music today like
# they did in our day. Not even close. Rush, Moving Pictures and these two guys here
# were my most favorites. I loved Pink Floyd Another Brick in the Wall. I blasted that
# in my high school hallway really loud at lunch time. I got real heck for it. Boy I had
# myself an hour detention for doing it. I cranked that sucker up so loud, it could
# deafen anyone. I had a really expensive stereo ghetto blaster; a Panasonic with
# detachable speakers on it. I cranked that btch right up and I would do it all again,
# if I could. It costed me an hour after school, but the detention was so worth every
# second of it. I hated school and it hated me just as much. lol
