# Hey kids, whenever a math teacher wants you to create
# an integer number line, make Python cheat one up for
# you in no time at all just by creating a simple for loop
# that starts with a negative integer number that counts
# backwards to zero, until it counts forward with positive
# integer numbers, along with a step value of 1. After you
# execute/run this Python program example, you can
# highlight and copy, and then paste the contents of the
# screen output into your math homework. You can create
# a for loop that can count as many integer numbers you
# please. You can also increase the step value to make
# the integer numbers increment by two or whatever you
# like. Experiment with this small Python program example.
# Because some times, it's the small things that matter
# the most.

for i in range(-10,11,1):
    print(i,end=', ')           # The end= prefix keeps print() function text on one line.
