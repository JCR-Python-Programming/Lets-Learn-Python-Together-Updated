# Normally, we have to use the programming standard 'self' word with def functions.
# But who says we have to do it here? Afterall, we can do whatever we want here and
# nobody can tell us any different. I'm simply showing you all what you can do in Python,
# but programmers DO NOT LIKE THIS. But we do. Let's use the word 'insane_snake' in
# place of 'self' with our def function example.

# Hope you guys are having as much fun as I am having. However, do not do this kind of
# programming if you want a programming job; the Boss won't be your Boss for very long.
# I showed you what not to do. lol
