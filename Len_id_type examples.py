# The 'len' function counts how many characters, including spaces there are inside of 
# a 'print' statement. The length of these two words "Hello World!", including the
# space in between 'Hello' and 'World!' are counted. For example: "Hello World!"
# including one space is twelve characters long. The printout on the screen will only
# show the number "12", not the actual words "Hello World!".

print(len('Hello World!'))

# Displays the id of the 'print' statement.

print(id('Hello World!'))

# Displays the type of the 'print' statement.

print(type('Hello World!'))

# Displays the id of the 'print' statement.

print(id(2+3))

# Displays the type of the 'print' statement.

print(type(2+3))
